# antlions

The scattered remains of old GMod project that I made in 2010-ish, from the days before I used proper version control. Originally intended to be a gamemode of humans vs antlions. See the GDD file for details.

It would be cool if this could be restored and expannded as an open source gamemode. If that's a vision you're interested in being a part of, or have questions about how to use this code for your own projects, please join the [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/seltzy/antlions.svg)](https://gitter.im/seltzy/antlions?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge).

This repo is broken into a few segments that were scattered between various hard drive backups.

## The projectA/B/C folders
The `projectA`, `projectB`, `projectC` folders are dysfunctional gamemodes. One appears to be an empty structure for a rewrite, another seems to be a minimal version with just basic antlion controls and progression mechanics, and another seems to be the start of a full campaign style gamemode. The latter clearly has more content, but as I recall it was rife with untested code and overengineering, so take it with a grain of salt.

None of them seem to be the definitive "right" version. Any restoration efforts should consider them all as being of relatively equal importance. Surgical code extraction from each into a fresh new gamemode would likely be the best approach to restoring it to a functional state.

## hl2_content
Decompiled Source engine content staged for modifications.

## mapsrc
Some maps used for development. Some of them are decompiled Source maps with and without edits, and some are from scratch.
